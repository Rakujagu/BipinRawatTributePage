      <h2>UN mission in Congo</h2>
      <br>
      <h3> CDS Bipin Rawat </h3>
      <p>Rawat commanded MONUSCO (a Multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of the
        Congo). Within two weeks of deployment in the DRC, the Brigade faced a major offensive in the east which
        threatened the regional capital of North Kivu, Goma. The offensive also threatened to destabilise the country as
        a whole. The situation demanded a rapid response and North Kivu Brigade was reinforced, where it was responsible
        for over 7,000 men and women, representing nearly half of the total MONUSCO force.
        <br> <br> Whilst simultaneously engaged in offensive kinetic operations against the CNDP and other armed groups,
        Rawat (then Brigadier) carried out tactical support to the Congolese Army (FARDC), He sensitization programmes
        with the local population and detailed coordination to ensure that all were informed about the situation and
        worked together in the progress of operations. He was responsible for the protection of the vulnerable
        population.

      <h3>CDS Bipin Rawat</h3>
      <p>In June 2015, eighteen Indian soldiers were killed in an ambush by militants belonging to the United Liberation
        Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) in Manipur. The Indian Army responded with cross-border strikes in
        which units of the 21st battalion of the Parachute Regiment struck an NSCN-K base in Myanmar. 21 Para was under
        the operational control of the Dimapur based III Corps, which was then commanded by Rawat.

      <h2>Doklam standoff with Chinese army</h2> <br>
      <h3>CDS Bipin Rawat</h3>
      <p>In 2017, at Doklam a 73-day military border standoff happened between the Indian Armed Forces and the People's
        Liberation Army of China over Chinese construction of a road in Doklam near a trijunction border area between
        Bhutan, China and India.
        <br> After the standoff ended Rawat said China had begun 'flexing its muscles' and was trying to 'nibble away'
        territory held by India in a gradual manner to test the limits of thresholds. He stated, India had to be "wary
        about" China, "and remain prepared for situations that could develop into conflicts"

      <h2>Ladakh standoff with Chinese Army</h2> <br>
      <h3>CDS Bipin Rawat</h3>
      <p>Beginning on 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive melee, face-offs and skirmishes at
        locations along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Tibet
        Autonomous Region, and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes also
        took place at locations in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
        <br> In late May, Chinese forces objected to Indian road construction in the Galwan river valley. According to
        Indian sources, melee fighting on 15/16 June 2020 resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and casualties of
        43 Chinese soldiers. Media reports stated that soldiers were taken captive on both sides and released in the
        coming few days while official sources on both sides went on to deny this. On 7 September, for the first time in
        45 years, shots were fired along the LAC, with both sides blaming each other for the firing. Indian media also
        reported that Indian troops fired warning shots at the PLA on 30 August
